### Modules

4. Maintaining modules

```
a. q: What modules are built-in provided by nodejs?
   a: https://nodejs.org/api/
   q: Is there a quick cross reference to the core functions?
   a: Good question!

b. NPM - node package manager
   q: How do I know what packages are installed?
   a: $ npm -g ls | less
```

### Modules

c. **OR** For freecodecampers [manage-packages-with-npm](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-packages-with-npm)

   * which is really a nodeschool [workshopper](https://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list) installed with

     `$ npm install how-to-npm`

---
### Restarting scripts automatically

try nodemon

`$ sudo npm install -g nodemon`

+ Website: [nodemon.io](https://nodemon.io/)

+ Documetation: [https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#nodemon)

+ Usage: `$ nodemon /js/app.js`

### Adding **Jasmine** to test our functions

   - Reference:

   - [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/node.html)

   - [npmjs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine)

       q: What is the point of these alternate packages?

         - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-node

         - https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node

       a:

---
### Jasmine Installation

```
       $ npm install --save-dev jasmine
       $ jasmine init
```

Writing a spec

```
       Describe
         It
           Expect
```

     Running the test
       $ jasmine

---
### Writing a module

     a. export constants and functions from the module

     b. require the `/path/filename.js` of the module

     c. note that in this example the test/specs are a directory down and need to reference up a directory then over to js directory
