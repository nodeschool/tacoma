8. Adding **Jasmine** to test our functions

     - Reference:

       - [npmjs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine)

       q: What is the point of these alternate packages?

         - https://www.npmjs.com/package/jasmine-node

         - https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node

       a:

---
     Jasmine Installation
       ```
       $ npm install --save-dev jasmine
       $ jasmine init
       ```
     Writing a spec
       ```
       Describe
         It
           Expect
       ```

     Running the test

9. Writing a module

     a. export constants and functions from the module

     b. require the `/path/filename.js` of the module

     c. note that in this example the test/specs are a directory down and need to reference up a directory then over to js directory
